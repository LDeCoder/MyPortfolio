          <p>
            I am currently seeking my first software development opportunity.
            <br />
            MY FAVORITES: HTML/CSS *And now SCSS *Because who couldn't use a
            little SASS!* <br />
            I have built a few applications with React.js <br />I am known for
            being fun! I LOVE a good play on words and quick wit! I don't take
            life too seriously, but I am serious about the work I do. I
            appreciate clarification between what is expected and what
            over-the-top is, because I am definitely self-motivated, and I want
            to go above and beyond! I don't like to make people wait on me, but
            I also rise to the occasion with approaching deadlines. I may not
            have all the answers, but I WILL find them! I love to learn, and I
            am excited to figure out how new technologies work! <br />
            If you give me an opportunity - I WON'T LET YOU DOWN!

            <br />
            <br />Check out my descriptions below of some of the experience I have from my previous employment (11 years) at my home church. As the Office Manager handling the daily accounting and operational duties, I also spent time on Web Development and Graphic Design, which is what prompted me to go to school to learn the full stack, and I absolutely cannot wait for an opportunity to get paid for doing what I LOVE!

            It was my responsibility to maintain up-to-date information on the website, as well as adding new pages and layouts, making logos for different ministries, their events, descriptions, and sending out notifications, etc.  The logos were created in Adobe Illustrator.

         While creating layout for printed materials, I honed my Adobe Illustrator skills by learning how to make logos that were both clean, sleek, and recognizable in any color scheme.  I vectorized them to be scalable, respecting importance of having images in the correct resolution for the channel in which they will be used.  You might have spotted my personal logo, LDeCoder, and yep, I designed that one as well!

           I designed the weekly bulletin and updated and printed it each week.  I used Adobe Illustrator to accomplish this, as well as creating business cards, prayer cards, handouts for conferences, and many other printed materials.  I also created a fasting booklet that was delivered as an eBook/.pdf.  This was additionally offered as a printed booklet with a cardstock cover that could be used as a journal and study companion.
